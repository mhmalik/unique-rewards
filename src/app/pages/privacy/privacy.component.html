            Data Security:
        </span>
        <p class="sp"></p>
        To prevent unauthorized access, maintain data accuracy, and ensure the correct use of information, UniqueRewards
        has used appropriate and standard industry procedures to safeguard the confidentiality of your personal
        information. Such information includes the nature of your firewall, encryption, token authentication,
        application proxies, monitoring technology, and adaptive analysis of network traffic to track abuse of our

            Links to Other Sites:
        </span>
        <p class="sp"></p>
        The UniqueRewards web site contains links to other sites. Please be aware that the company, UniqueRewards.com,
        is not responsible for the privacy practices of such linked sites. We encourage our users to be aware when they
        leave our site and to read the privacy statements of each and every Web site that collects personally
        identifiable information. The UniqueRewards privacy statement applies solely to information collected by the
        UniqueRewards Web Site.

            Opting-Out:
        </span>
        <p class="sp"></p>
        Established members will occasionally receive e-mails containing information regarding new offers or special
        promotions from UniqueRewards -- if they have not opted out. By "opting-out" the user indicates that he or she
        does not wish to receive such e-mails from UniqueRewards.com. The opt-out can be performed upon initial
        registration or later. You may optout of receiving these newsletters at any time by updating your account
        information in the UniqueRewards "My Profile" section. You can reach the "My Profile" section by clicking on the
        "My Profile" button in the main user's menu. When you reach this page, uncheck the box that reads, "Yes, I want
        to receive special cash offers".
        <p class="sp"></p>
        When a member receives a special offer or promotion e-mail from UniqueRewards.com and decides that he or she no
        longer wishes to receive such e-mails, the member can open the e-mail and scroll to the bottom. At the bottom of
        the e-mail page there will be a brief description of how to have an account "opted-out". Once UniqueRewards
        receives information regarding these account changes the company will make the specified changes as soon as
        possible.

            Site and Service Announcements:
        </span>
        <p class="sp"></p>
        Under rare circumstances UniqueRewards.com may need to contact specific or all users in order to make an
        important announcement about the UniqueRewards site or service changes. Members are not able to unsubscribe, or
        "opt-out" of these announcements, because they may contain very important information regarding their accounts.
        Before these measures are taken, however, UniqueRewards will post information regarding changes directly on the
        web site. UniqueRewards.com reserves the right to contact users to correct account errors or to supply important
        information UniqueRewards deems relevant.
        <p class="sp"></p>
        <span class="treb18b green">
            Correction/Updating Personal Information:
        </span>
        <p class="sp"></p>
        UniqueRewards users are able to change their personal information at any time. The fastest way to change
        personal information is to login to UniqueRewards.com and simply click on "My Profile". You will be prompted to
        enter your password again to change you personal information. If for some reason this page does not work, or
        there are any questions, users may contact our Member Support Team. Users should send our support team a clear

            SPAM
        </span>
        <p class="sp"></p>
        We will immediately terminate any account, which we believe, at our sole discretion, is transmitting or is
        otherwise connected with any Spam or other unsolicited bulk e-mails and postings.
        <p class="sp"></p>
        We will not tolerate any such activities on our site or server of members who are involved in SPAM or related
        abuses. Our actions may include contacting relevant authorities (such as employers, universities, local law
        enforcement, the FBI) as well as asking Internet Service providers to deny service.
        <p class="sp"></p>
        SPAM includes, but is not limited to, unsolicited e-mails and/or postings in discussion groups, bulletin boards,
        and other public domain groups. Most network providers generally prohibit SPAM messages and in certain
        jurisdictions those users employing them may be subject to fines and/or imprisonment. We do not allow our
        members to utilize SPAM messages. The company will automatically terminate all spamming accounts.
        <p class="sp"></p>
        The only acceptable methods of referring someone to our UniqueRewards.com Rewards Online Program are through
        communication with family and friends, as well as through establishing a link to our web site on a member-owned
        Web site.
