            Your account is credited for completing Cash Offer as soon as the advertiser reports the transaction to
            UniqueRewards. For most Cash Offers, this process occurs within 12 to 48 hours. Some Cash Offers with
            extended delayed report can take up to 30 days to credit to your account. If more than 30 days have passed
            since completing a Cash Offer and you have still not been credited, please send us a confirmation email from
            the offer and our support team will assist you further.

            Offers sometimes fail to credit. This can be due to many reasons, including:
            <ul>
                <li>Browser's refusal to accept cookies
                <li>Security measures set by the operating system or other software such as popup blockers
                <li>Ad-blocking software, on your computer or enforced by your employer, school, or network
                    administrator.
                <li>Adware/malware/spyware which can "hijack" affiliate links so that the software publisher gets credit
                    instead.
                <li>Your have forgotten to click on a confirmation link from completed offer.
                <li>Just plain bad luck -- occasionally you may do everything right and simply not get credited.
                <li>Unfortunately, the system is not perfect (but it's the best we can do).
            </ul>
            If you have previously completed the Cash Offer (either through another web site or with the advertiser
            directly), you will not be credited for completing the Cash Offer through UniqueRewards.
            <p class="sp"></p>
            In order to minimize the risk of these problems occurring, please:
            <ul>
                <li>Temporarily disable any ad-blocking software while using UniqueRewards.
                <li>Clear your cookies and cache before logging in to Uniquerewards.
                <li>Set your browser to accept all cookies. You can find instructions on how to do so in your browser's
                    "Help" area.
                <li>Always copy and paste confirmation links from email messages into the address bar of the same
                    browser you used to sign up.

            Unless the Cash Offer description specifically states that you must remain past the free trial in order to
            be credited, then you will receive credit from UniqueRewards for signing up for the free trial. Canceling
            the free trial will not affect your credit from UniqueRewards.
            <p class="sp"></p>
            Some advertisers may not provide credit if you cancel immediately after signing up for the free trial
            without even taking the opportunity to receive their product/service so you could evaluate it.

            To ensure you receive credit for your purchase, please follow the instructions below.
            <p class="sp"></p>
            <li>Enable Cookies<br />
                Our tracking relies on cookies to function. If you do not have cookies enabled, our stores will not know
                you made your purchase through UniqueRewards . This means that the store will not be able to notify
                UniqueRewards of your purchase and we will not be able to give you credit for your purchase.<BR>
                Please make sure that your security software (anti-virus software) does not override this feature.
                <p class="sp"></p>
            </li>
            <li>Enable Pop-ups<br />
                Store websites typically open in new browser windows for your convenience. Thus, you need to have popups
                enabled for the Cashback Shopping section to function properly.<BR>
                Please make sure that your security software (anti-virus software) does not override this feature.
                <p class="sp"></p>
            </li>
            <li>Do Not Bookmark<br />
                You cannot bookmark the store website and return later to make your purchase because you will go
                directly to the store's site rather than being directed there as a member of UniqueRewards. This means
                that the store will not be able to notify UniqueRewards of your purchase and we will not be able to give
                you credit for your purchase.
                <p class="sp"></p>
            </li>
            <li>Complete Spyware Scan<br />
                Make sure you are not infected with Spyware. One of the main features of Spyware applications is to
                "hijack" referral information. For example, if you click on a store from the UniqueRewards Cashback
                Shopping page and are infected with Spyware, the Spyware application overwrites our tracking information
                with their own. Thus, the creator of the Spyware application is credited for the transaction and thus we
                are unable to credit you.

                Yes, it's a really good way to earn a lot of money.<BR>
                We have an Unique Referall's System:<BR>
                1. We pay $1 when each of your referral completes his/her first offer.<BR>
                Any easiest offer! Even if its cost is only $0.10!<BR>
                2. We pay $5 for every active referral!<BR>
                It means that every time when one of your referrals earns $20 or more gets the "active" status and you
                also earn $5! Just once for one referral.<BR>
                3. We pay 10% of the Qualified Earnings received by your referrals! For your lifetime!
                <p class="sp"></p>
                There is no restriction on the number of referrals one can have. Read <a

                            website?</span></a></p>
                <p style="float:right;"><a style="vertical-align:middle;" href="#top">Top</a></p>
                <div class="ClearDiv"></div>
                Putting our banner on your website requires a bit of technical knowledge. If you are unfamiliar with
                HTML, please ask for help from your friends and family or search for <a
                    href="https://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;q=html+tutorial" target=_new>online tutorials</a>.
                <p class="sp"></p>
                The steps below can get you started:
                <p></p>
                1. Visit our <a href="cgi-bin/mainfb65.html?cmd=refpage">Referral page</a> to view all available banners
                and the HTML code needed for your website. The code consists of a link to your referral link at
                UniqueRewards and a connection to the banner. It is not necessary to download a banner to your website.
                <p></p>
                2. Once you have copied the text, open the window with your website's HTML code and paste the banner's
                code where you'd like it. You can do this by right-clicking the mouse in the appropriate spot and
                selecting "Paste." Save your changes and our banner should appear on your website. Note: You may have to
                refresh/reload your website for the banner to appear.
                <p class="sp"></p>
                <p style="float:left"><a name="21"><span class="treb18b green">How much money do I need in my account in
                            order to cash out?</span></a></p>
                <p style="float:right;"><a style="vertical-align:middle;" href="#top">Top</a></p>
                <div class="ClearDiv"></div>
                The minimum balance for cashing out is $20 for PayPal and Bitcoin, and $50 if you want to receive your
                funds via VISA and MasterCard or by check.
                <p></p>
                If you decide to cash out the money to your personal Visa or MasterCard, and you do not want to wait
                until it reaches $50, you can request a smaller amount of cash, but not less than $35. In this case, a
                small fee will be charged only by the payment provider, but not by UniqueRewards.
                <p></p>
                The first example: You have earned $50 and requested the payment. Then, the whole amount will be
                transferred to your Visa or MasterCard.
                <p></p>
                The second: You've earned $35 and requested the payment. In this case the payment provider charges a
                commission fee, so eventually you will get the requested amount minus commission fee to your Visa or
                Mastercard.
                <p class="sp"></p>
                <p style="float:left"><a name="22"><span class="treb18b green">How do I request a payment?</span></a>

                <div class="ClearDiv"></div>
                To request payment, click the "request payment" link in your "Balance". We'll pay you through Visa,
                MasterCard, PayPal, Bitcoin and by check. You'll be able to choose the most suitable method for you!
                <p></p>
                If you've already had a PayPal account which is different from your UniqueRewards e-mail ID, you should
                add UniqueRewards e-mail ID to your PayPal account.
                <p></p>
                If your PayPal e-mail address is the same as in our system you don't need to do additional actions to
                get payment, money will be sent to your PayPal account.
                <p></p>
                NOTE: All the users are supposed to be from US, CA, and UK. UniqueRewards.com reserves the right to ask
                all users to request their first payment by check.

                <div class="ClearDiv"></div>
                Our members are paid on a weekly basis, each Monday. For example, if you order money on Tuesday, your
                earnings will be sent on the following Monday evening.
                <p class="sp"></p>
                NOTE: We don't have any certain time for payments on Mondays. e.g. one week we can pay in the morning
                and the other week in the evening.
                <p class="sp"></p>
                UniqueRewards may delay the payment for some time if there is a suspicion that the completed
                offers/surveys might be reversed by the advertiser.
                <p class="sp"></p>
                If payments are delayed for some reason, we always announce it on <a
